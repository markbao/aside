		<h1>Cloudmarks Help</h1>
		
		<h2>Setting the hotkey</h2>
		
		<p>To set the hotkey that invokes the Cloudmarks popup, click inside the input box and press 
			the desired key combination. The hotkey is saved immediately and can be used right away.</p>
		<p>The hotkey can be any character key, with or without modifiers such as Command, Option, 
			and Shift. By &quot;character key&quot; we mean any key that produces a visible character 
			if you press it while typing text. (This excludes special keys such as PageDown, Home, 
			NumLock, the arrow keys, etc.)</p>
		<p>If you enter a key combination involving the Shift and/or Option keys, what appears in the 
			input box is the character that would appear if you typed that key combination normally. 
			So, for example, if you press Option-Y, you will see the character 
			<span class='char'>&yen;</span> in the input box, not the words "Option-Y"; but your 
			hotkey will in fact be Option-Y.</p>
		<p>Note: If you enter a hotkey that invokes a built-in Safari command, such as Command-P, 
			Cloudmarks will save the hotkey, but it won't prevent Safari from executing the built-in 
			command.</p>
		
		<h2>Settings for opening bookmarks</h2>
		
		<p><strong>Open bookmark in new tab</strong><br />If this option is selected, the highlighted 
			bookmark will open in a new tab instead of the current tab when you press Enter.</p>
		<p>Note: You can temporarily reverse this setting by holding down the Command key when pressing 
			Enter.</p>
		<p><strong>Open new tab in background</strong><br />If this option is selected, when opening a 
			bookmark in a new tab, the new tab will be opened in the background. Otherwise, the new tab 
			will become active upon opening.</p>
		<p>Note: You can temporarily reverse this setting by holding down the Shift key when pressing 
			Enter.</p>
		<p><strong>Position new tab next to current tab</strong><br />If this option is selected, when 
			opening a bookmark in a new tab, the new tab will be placed next to the current tab. 
			Otherwise, it will be placed at the end.</p>
		<p><strong>Use new window instead of new tab</strong><br />If this option is selected, when 
			opening a bookmark in a new tab, the bookmark will open in a new window instead.</p>
		<p>Note: If this option is selected, the previous two options have no effect.</p>
